# hello-world
This is my first attempt to open source. I don't know what content to put in, but I am sure it will come over time. 
Now I type some stuff according to the tutorial of GitHub. I am here to understand GitHub, because we are using it in our organization. I want to know what kind of decision processes are suitable for open source development. And I came here through Redhat.
